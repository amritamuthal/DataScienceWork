-- Query 1:
-- List the name of customers who have rented more than 25 movies
-- For this query, I have used two tables- Student and Courses.
-- The data from these two tables have been joined based on the customer_id and then grouped by with first_name.
-- Query to 
Select Customer.first_name, Customer.last_name, count(rental.rental_id) AS Number_Of_Movies, DATE_PART ('year', Customer.create_date)
From (Customer
Join Rental ON customer.customer_id = rental.customer_id)
Group by first_name, last_name, create_date
having count(customer.customer_id)>25
Order by Last_name;


-- Query 2: 
-- We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: 
-- Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.
-- Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.
-- Query to 
Select p.title, p.name, count(p.rental_ID)
from
(
select a.title, c.name, r.rental_ID, r.inventory_ID 
from film a
join film_category b
on a.film_id = b.film_ID
join category c
on b.category_ID = c.category_ID
join inventory i
on a.film_id = i.film_ID
join rental r
on i.inventory_ID = r.inventory_ID
  ) p
group by p.title, p.name
order by p.name, p.title


-- Query 3: 
-- Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all 
-- movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, 
-- second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies 
-- across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.
-- You should only need the category, film_category, and film tables to answer this and the next questions.
-- Query to 
SELECT f.title AS film_title, c.name AS category_name, f.rental_duration, 
NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile 
FROM category c 
JOIN film_category fc 
ON c.category_id=fc.category_id 
JOIN film f ON fc.film_id=f.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music');

-- Query 4: 
-- Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies 
-- within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three 
-- columns: Category, Rental length category, Count
-- Query to 
SELECT category_name, standard_quartile, COUNT(film_title) AS movie_count 
FROM 
( 
SELECT f.title AS film_title, c.name AS category_name, f.rental_duration, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile 
FROM category c, film_category fc, film f 
WHERE c.category_id=fc.category_id AND fc.film_id=f.film_id AND c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music') 
) t1 
GROUP BY 1, 2 
ORDER BY 1, 2;
